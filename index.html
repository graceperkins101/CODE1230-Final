<title>Assignment 3 -Flexible Housing for Indigenous Women</title>
<br><br><br>


<h1>Problem</h1>
    <p> 
        Indigenous people need safe and proper housing. However, despite the Australian governments promises to fund proper housing for the indigenous, it has failed to achieve anything and today it is very ‘normal’ for indigenous housing to be overcrowded. Some even lack twenty-four-hour service to water and internet (particularly those located in rural areas). Underfunded and neglected, these housing places have lead to a higher rate of homelessness for indigenous people, especially indigenous women. 
        <br>
        <a href="http://theconversation.com/factcheck-qanda-are-indigenous-women-34-80-times-more-likely-than-average-to-experience-violence-61809" target=_blank">The Conversation</a> recently shed light on the disadvantage of indigenous women compared to non-indigenous female counterparts. With Indigenous women are ‘35 times more likely to experience domestic and family violence’ (<a href="https://www.dss.gov.au/women/programs-services/reducing-violence/the-national-plan-to-reduce-violence-against-women-and-their-children-2010-2022" target=_blank">The National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children 2010-2022</a>) and '31 times more likely to be hospitalised due to domestic and family violence related assaults compared to non-indigenous females’ (<a href="https://www.pc.gov.au/research/ongoing/overcoming-indigenous-disadvantage" target=_blank">the Australian Government's Productivity Commission's report 'Overcoming Indigenous Disadvantage'</a>).  
    </p>
    <br><br><br>


<h1>Aim</h1>
    <p> 
        To implement safe and flexible housing in Redfern (Sydney, NSW) for people who identify as Indigenous female (Aboriginal and/or Torres St Islander). Housing for women that understands the need for a safe environment to grow and thrive and connect with other women. Especially, housing that has the flexibility to accommodate a state of constant change in the number of people living there.  Housing that can both expand and condense.

<h1>Story</h1>
    <p> 
        Assignment 2 shed light on the gap between indigenous and non-indigenous geographical location in NSW, birth rate, family growth and age span. My data revealed a much higher birth rate and population growth of indigenous people compared with non-indigenous people. It showed rapid population growth and also the change in population density in NSW. There was a shift to more urban living areas towards the coast of NSW, especially Sydney, and shortly followed by Wollongong. However, the indigenous population was largely found in areas below the latte line.
        <br>
        As discussed in my last assignment, Sydney had the largest population of indigenous people in NSW. With my qgis maps showing Redfern a suburb in Sydney as a area with an extremely high number of Indigenous individuals living there.  Further research into Redfern, shed light on why it was a large population hub for indigenous people, as it has many community centres in the area that focus support on the indigenous community.

    <p>
        The unused grass patch I chose to place the Indigenous housing is next to the Redfern train station and community centre, and the land is currently unused, so it could be built immediately.

<h1>Design</h1>
    <p> 
        The main goal I wanted to achieve through my building design is flexibility and independence. As the building is open to all indigenous women, the number of bedrooms needed will constantly change as the number of people living there will change. This is further heightened by the fact that indigenous women have an extremely high birth rate compared to non-indigenous women. Therefore even more rooms will be needed. This is why the main core focus of my building is flexibility -the ability to change to unforeseen demands and yet space in the building design for it to be built upon further in the future.  
        <br>
        Each level has eight rectangular bedrooms surrounding a large circular meeting place, where the bathroom, kitchen, living room and lift will be placed. The room is circular because I wanted it to physically represent the ‘meeting place’ symbol in indigenous culture, with the rectangular bedrooms all connecting to it so it creates a place for any women to meet, gather, talk and connect. A physical place all rooms are united too.

    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        There are other indigenous symbols that look similar to the ‘meeting place’ symbol. Such as the symbol for ‘people sitting’. These symbols look similar and are tied by their familiar meaning -a place for people to connect. 
        <br>
        This main circular room is surrounded by a series of rectangular bedrooms. The number of rectangular bedrooms can increase and decrease in size depending on the number of inhabitants living on the level. That is why there are large gaps and spaces between each rectangular bedroom in my rhino diagram, as the gaps allow for the growth for more members and for children, so it gives the female a chance of being a single parent if they desire it. The maximum number of rectangular bedrooms is not on show in my rhino diagram because I wanted to show that these rooms can simply be detached from the apartment floor
    </p>

    <br>
    <p>
        Each floor is capable of holding the same number of bedrooms a house could hold. But as indigenous people usually live with a higher number of people in the same living space, my building specifically focuses on the ability to provide multiple rooms onto one floor, so that everyone can have a bedroom despite how many people living there at once. 
        <br>
        The top floor of my design building has a series of hallways with lifts at the end of them. These lifts are able to drop people down to the street floor. The hallway itself is like an arm that can extend out and go left-or-right, whilst the lift will drop the person down to the ground floor by a strong cable wire. I incorporated this floor into my design because it offers indigenous women a chance to go to work, meet with family or friends and carry out any of their daily tasks that need to be done in a much more flexible way, without the need for a car and gives them more independence. 
        <br>
        The second and third top floors of my design building have no lifts or rectangular bedrooms. Instead these two floors are not living spaces but are a day care (a place for women to leave their child if need be) and a health clinic (a place for women to check themselves out with a female doctor for any injuries or a therapist if need be, especially if they are new to the building and are removing themselves from domestic or family violence/abuse).
